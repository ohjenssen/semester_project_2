# Noroff - Semester Project 2

## This is my second semester project at Noroff. Here we take the skills learned over the past three semester and create an auction website. The following is the project brief:

> An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

> When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.
